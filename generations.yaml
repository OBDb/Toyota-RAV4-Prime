    description: "The Toyota RAV4 Prime represents the brand's most powerful compact SUV offering and the first plug-in hybrid variant of its popular RAV4 crossover. Based on the fifth-generation RAV4 platform and sharing its bold, angular styling with conventional and hybrid RAV4 models, the Prime is distinguished by subtle styling cues including a unique front fascia with vertical LED accent lights, model-specific 19-inch wheels on higher trims, and distinctive Prime badging. The powertrain combines an enhanced version of the 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle gasoline engine with more powerful electric motors and a substantial 18.1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, creating a total system output of 302 horsepower—83 more than the standard RAV4 Hybrid. This substantial power increase enables impressive performance with 0-60 mph acceleration in just 5.7 seconds, making it the second-quickest vehicle in Toyota's lineup behind only the GR Supra. The large battery enables an EPA-rated 42 miles of electric-only range—the highest of any plug-in hybrid SUV at introduction—allowing many commuters to operate primarily on electric power for daily driving. When the battery is depleted, the RAV4 Prime functions as a conventional hybrid achieving 38 mpg combined. Charging from a standard 120V outlet takes approximately 12 hours, reduced to 4.5 hours with a 240V Level 2 charger (or 2.5 hours with the optional 6.6 kW onboard charger). The standard Electronic On-Demand AWD system provides all-weather capability through a dedicated rear electric motor. Available in SE and XSE trim levels, the RAV4 Prime offers a compelling combination of features including standard heated seats, a 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system on the XSE trim, and available premium amenities like a head-up display, panoramic moonroof, and JBL premium audio system. The RAV4 Prime successfully combines exceptional efficiency, strong performance, and practical utility in a mainstream crossover package, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers who want electric capability without the range limitations of a fully electric vehicle."
