    description: "The Toyota RAV4 Prime (known as RAV4 PHEV in other markets and renamed RAV4 Plug-in Hybrid for the 2025 model year in North America) is the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) variant of the fifth-generation RAV4 compact crossover SUV. Unveiled at the December 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show and sales beginning in June 2020, the Prime shares its bold, angular styling with conventional and hybrid RAV4 models but features subtle distinguishing elements including a unique front fascia, model-specific badging, and charging port integration. The powertrain combines a specially-tuned 2.5-liter A25A-FXS Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine producing 177 hp with two electric motors—one driving the front wheels (40 kW) and another powering the rear (54 kW)—fed by an 18.1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. This configuration delivers a total system output of 302 horsepower (83 hp more than the standard RAV4 Hybrid) and 227 lb-ft of torque, enabling acceleration from 0-60 mph in just 5.8 seconds and making it the second-quickest vehicle in Toyota's lineup behind the GR Supra. The Prime offers an EPA-rated 42 miles of all-electric range—the highest of any plug-in hybrid SUV at its introduction—allowing many commuters to operate primarily on electric power for daily driving. When depleted, it functions as a conventional hybrid achieving 38 mpg combined. Charging from a 120V outlet takes approximately 12 hours, reduced to 4.5 hours with a 240V Level 2 charger (or 2.5 hours with the optional 6.6 kW onboard charger). Standard Electronic On-Demand AWD provides all-weather capability through the rear electric motor. Available in SE and XSE trim levels (North America), the Prime features standard heated seats, Toyota Safety Sense 2.0, and available premium amenities including a head-up display, panoramic moonroof, and JBL audio. A September 2021 facelift brought updated LED projector headlights, new alloy wheel designs, and USB-C charging ports. The Prime is imported to North America from Toyota's Nagakusa plant in Japan."
